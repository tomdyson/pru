        <p class="measure lh-copy">
            Pru Jeffrey’s funeral will take place at St John’s the Baptist Church, Fladbury,
            on Monday June 14th, at 12:00am BST.
        </p>
        <p class="measure lh-copy">
            A video recording of the service should be available here within a day. I will also try to
            stream it live, but this is dependent on the strength of the mobile signal, which is variable.
            If it’s not working for you, the problem is almost certainly because our connection isn’t strong enough.
            Any streaming issues will not affect the quality of the final recording. Please contact me
            on tom@torchbox.com if you have any questions.
        </p>

            after 12:00 BST on June 14th. If there’s a message that "The media could not be loaded", please
            wait a minute and refresh the page. If it becomes clear that streaming will not work, I’ll update
            this page with a message.
